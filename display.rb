# Display handles drawing of any kind. There are three ways to draw stuff.
# Text: It takes a string and converts it into array of symbols to be drawn.
# Buffer: The actual game state is stored in the buffer, which Display reads and draws stuff.
# GUI (frames, 'selectors' etc.) - context sensitive!
